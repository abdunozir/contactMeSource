### contactMeSource is a personal and simple project that anyone can use.

## Here is how you can use this api.

```javascript
{
  chatId:123124,
  botToken: "token here",
  userName: "name",
  message: "message here",
  contact: "contact info"
}

```

## chatID 
  To use the API, you need your Telegram ChatID. To get your ChatID, visit this [bot](https://t.me/Getmyaccountinfobot) and press the start button. The [bot](https://t.me/Getmyaccountinfobot) will then send your ChatID.  

## botToken 
Create your own bot using BotFather on Telegram. BotFather will then send you your bot token, and all messages will be sent to you via your bot.
  
## userName, message, contact
 The project does not restrict the data that can be inserted. However, it is important to validate any data that is entered by the user to ensure accuracy and prevent errors.
